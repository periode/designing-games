# Designing Games

Repo for the IMA Low Res course, winter 2024.

## Course Description

Most social interactions can be seen as some sort of playful event, but games tend to be more specific, designed artifacts with rules, stories and mechanics. In this course, we will learn the basics of game design and game development as we create our own games in the Unity game engine. As we cover fundamental concepts such as core mechanics, balance, tutorial, economy, systems, role-playing, narrative, conflict and cooperation, we will see how games can also act as dynamic representations of life, and thus can provide social and political commentaries.

From a technical standpoint, we will build up a solid basis in game development concepts such as object-oriented programming, vector math, procedural animation and sound design, as well play-testing and iterative feedback.
